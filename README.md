TheGreatLutonMystery
====================
This is a murder mystery party written oer the course of a few months. 

I'm opening this up for people to use and contribute to, it has been played once successfully but is by no means perfect.

Players: 27 playable characters + 2 hosts

Duration: Roughly 4.5 hours

Setting: Luton, England in 1666

Notes for hosting:
This is a party is not designed with children in mind. It may be possible to change some characters to accomodate them but it was not planned for. As an example, some characters have drinking alcohol written in as part of their character description.

To set up this murder mystery party you will need to get reliable RSVP's from the 27 people you wish to invite. There will likely be one or two last minute cancellations so it's always useful to have a few people that can come in a pinch. It's also very important not to have guests that are not part of the story at the party to ensure that everyone stays in character for the whole night. It's also important to get the gender ratio correct, there are a few gender-neutral characters to make this a little more flexible.

Once you have your guests lined up, assign each one a character from the Public Character Descriptions file. We find that it's usually a good idea for these events to separate couples so that their characters aren't closely tied to one another as they will either reveal all of their information to each other, or feel disgruntled when the other opposes them.
